UNREAL ENGINE SECTION:

Q: Is Unreal Engine Free?
A: [RESEARCH NEEDED] 
Notes: Need to investigate pricing model, licensing terms, and revenue sharing requirements.

CUSTOM ART & ANIMATION SECTION:

Q: Can I use my own drawn cat picture as TacoCat's avatar?
A: Yes! We can replace the simple colored rectangles with your custom artwork.
Notes: Need to scan/digitize hand-drawn image, convert to PNG format, and implement in game code.

Q: Can we animate the custom avatar?
A: Yes! We can add animations like blinking, tail wagging, happiness expressions, etc.
Notes: Can create frame-based animations or procedural animations using your artwork.

START MENU & SAVE SYSTEM SECTION:

Q: What features are needed for a Start Menu system?
A: Complete workflow requires these components:
Notes: 
- Start Menu screen with options: New Game, Continue, Quit
- Save Game functionality (store player progress)
- Load Game functionality (restore saved progress)
- Exit Game functionality
- State management (menu vs gameplay states)

Q: What data needs to be saved?
A: [TO BE DETERMINED] Current game state includes:
Notes: Player stats (coins, health, food), TacoCat happiness level, player position, game progress

Q: Where should save data be stored?
A: [TO BE DETERMINED] Options include:
Notes: Browser localStorage (free, simple), server database (complex), file export/import

DYNAMIC MAP EXPANSION SECTION:

Q: Can we make the map dynamically expandable?
A: Yes! We can implement a dynamic world system with multiple approaches.
Notes: 
- TILE-BASED SYSTEM: Divide world into tiles/chunks that load as player moves
- SCROLLING WORLD: Large canvas that scrolls as player moves (like classic RPGs)
- ROOM-BASED SYSTEM: Different areas/rooms connected by transitions
- INFINITE WORLD: Generate new areas procedurally as player explores

Q: What are the technical considerations for dynamic maps?
A: [TO BE DETERMINED] Key factors include:
Notes: 
- Performance (rendering large areas vs loading chunks)
- Save system (how to save expanded world state)
- Player boundaries (how to handle edge cases)
- Asset management (loading new tiles/areas)
- Memory usage (keeping track of explored areas)

Q: What type of expansion would work best for TacoCat?
A: [TO BE DETERMINED] Options include:
Notes:
- Simple room system (Forest, Cave, Village areas)
- Scrolling world (like classic Zelda games)
- Tile-based exploration (like Minecraft chunks)
- Procedural generation (like infinite worlds)

STANDALONE APPLICATION SECTION:

Q: Is it possible to make the game initialize in its own window, not in a web browser?
A: Yes! Multiple options available for converting HTML5 games to standalone applications.
Notes:
- ELECTRON: Most popular, turns HTML5 games into desktop apps (used by Discord, VS Code)
- Tauri: Rust-based alternative to Electron (smaller, faster)
- PWA (Progressive Web App): Can install from browser, runs like native app
- NW.js: Another option similar to Electron
- Native packaging tools for distribution

Q: What are the pros and cons of each standalone option?
A: [TO BE DETERMINED] Key considerations:
Notes:
- ELECTRON: Large file size, but very reliable and widely used
- Tauri: Much smaller, but requires Rust knowledge
- PWA: Easy to implement, works on mobile too, but limited desktop features
- Performance differences, distribution options, development complexity

Q: Which option would work best for TacoCat's budget constraints?
A: [TO BE DETERMINED] Budget considerations:
Notes:
- PWA: Completely free, easiest to implement
- Electron: Free but creates larger distribution files
- All options maintain the HTML5/JavaScript codebase
- No need to rewrite the game in different languages

AUDIO & SOUND SYSTEM SECTION:

Q: Can we add sound files to give the game additional depth?
A: Yes! HTML5 has excellent audio support and there are many free sound resources available.
Notes:
- HTML5 Audio API: Built-in browser support for .mp3, .wav, .ogg files
- Web Audio API: Advanced audio processing and effects
- Free sound libraries: Freesound.org, OpenGameArt.org, Zapsplat
- Simple implementation: Just a few lines of JavaScript code

Q: What types of sounds would enhance TacoCat?
A: [TO BE DETERMINED] Sound categories to consider:
Notes:
- Sound Effects: Coin collection, footsteps, button clicks, TacoCat happiness sounds
- Ambient Audio: Background music, environmental sounds (birds, wind)
- UI Sounds: Menu interactions, save confirmation, level up sounds
- Character Sounds: Cat meows, purrs, happy sounds for TacoCat

Q: What are the technical considerations for game audio?
A: [TO BE DETERMINED] Implementation factors:
Notes:
- File formats: MP3 (universal), OGG (better compression), WAV (uncompressed)
- File sizes: Keep sounds small for web loading
- Browser compatibility: Most modern browsers support HTML5 audio
- Performance: Preload important sounds, use audio sprites for efficiency

Q: Where can we find free game sounds?
A: [TO BE DETERMINED] Free audio resources:
Notes:
- Freesound.org: Huge library of free sounds with CC licenses
- OpenGameArt.org: Game-specific audio assets
- Zapsplat: Free tier with registration
- YouTube Audio Library: Free music and sound effects
- Audacity: Free software for editing/creating sounds
